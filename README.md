# 🗓️ Daily Habits & Routine Tracker

Welcome to my personal habit and routine tracker!  
This repository is dedicated to helping me stay **consistent**, build **discipline**, and develop **productive daily habits** by writing down my **goals every morning** and reflecting on my **progress every night**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Set daily intentions and goals in the morning

## 📝 How I Use This Repo

1. **Every Morning**:  
   I create a new file under `goals/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and write down my top habits or tasks for the day.

2. **Every Night**:  
   I return to the file and check off what I completed and write a quick reflection.

3. **Every Week/Month**:  
   I update `summary.md` with insights and track improvement.
